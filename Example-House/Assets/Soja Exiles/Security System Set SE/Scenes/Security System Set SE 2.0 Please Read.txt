Thank you so much for purchasing the new Security System Set SE!

This package is the first of many Build kits that will allow you to build your own scene towards specific themes in a modern scenario.  

The Build Kit is made based off a grid system X, Z, Y  Walls & Floors of 2.5 X 2.5 X 4, you can use Unity’s progrids in assisted building.

The Interior walls sit on top of the interor floors in order to have a nice seamless fit.

Future updates will include the addition of a build kit for the following packages

-	Wine Liquor Beer and Glassware Package,
-	Barbers Package 
-	Sake Glassware & Prop Package

I am looking to build the tools for the developers to create a whole world, I would love to feature your scenes on my website.  

Send me screen shots on your creations to sojaexiles@support.com with your unity user name so I can give proper credit.

When running the demo, you can swtich scense with the number pad on top of the keyboard.

This package has working doors, so click away while you browse.  When you use a new prefab with a working script, you need to link the player to the script ot make the doors and windows work, this tells the script what can open the doors and windows.  I have included a PDF document called Prefab Doors so you can see how to link it.

Please rate the package, it really helps support my direction on creating new content and better content, and if you have any ideas on my next package or how to improve this package, please send me an email.

Thanks!
